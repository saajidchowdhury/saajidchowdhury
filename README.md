# About me

- Currently simulating ion immersed in ultracold low-density gas of polar molecules.
- Used unbiased global optimization and quantum Monte Carlo to study ion solvation, ionic polarons, and protonated argon clusters.
- Simulated chaotic trapped ion-atom interactions using MATLAB in parallel on GPU.
- Competed in ICPC regionals for 3 years. President of SBU Comp Prog.
- I love to optimize everything. I love to solve challenging problems.
