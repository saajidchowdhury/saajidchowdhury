# About me

- I’m currently working on simulating an ion immersed in an ultracold low-density gas of polar molecules.
- I've used basin hopping, conformational space annealing, and quantum diffusion Monte Carlo methods to study ion solvation, ionic polarons, and protonated argon clusters.
- I've used MATLAB to run simulations of chaotic trapped ion-atom interactions in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs.
- I've participated in ICPC regional contests for three years, and I am currently the president of the SBU Competitive Programming Club.
- I love to optimize everything, from algorithm runtimes to atomic cluster geometries to time management.
