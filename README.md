# About me

- I’m currently simulating an ion immersed in an ultracold low-density gas of polar molecules.
- I've used unbiased global optimization techniques and quantum Monte Carlo methods to study ion solvation, ionic polarons, and protonated argon clusters.
- I've simulated chaotic trapped ion-atom interactions using MATLAB in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs.
- I've competed in ICPC regionals for three years. I am currently the president of the SBU Competitive Programming Club.
- I love to optimize everything, from algorithm runtimes to atomic cluster geometries. I love to solve challenging problems.
